#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. It is a concept that systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including cummunication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. The birth of software engineering- The tearm software engineering was first introduced during a NATO conference in Carmisch, Germany in 1968 which marked the recognition of software development as a distinct engineering discipline. The development of early programming languages- The development of FORTRAN in 1957 which was the first high=level programming language, designed for scientific and engineering calculations. Development of COBOL in 1959 purposely for business data processing and became one of the most widely used languages in the business world. The rise of object-oriented programming such as Smalltalk in 1972 and C++ in 1985


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Analysis- understand and document what the software is supposed to do, Design- Create a blueprint for the software that meets the requirements, Develop- Build what you designed by translating it into actual code, Testing- Identify and fix any defects or bugs in software, Impelement- Make the software available for use, Maintenance- keep the software running smoothly and effeciently after it is deployed, Evaluation- assess the performance of the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. The proces flows in one direction like a waterfall. Agile methodology on the other hand is a flexible, iterative approach that focuses on delivering small, workable pieces of software in short cycles called sprints (usually 2-4 weeks). A. Agile is highly flexible and adaptable while waterfall is more rigid and structured. B. Waterfall requires thorough upfront planning whereas Agile involves continuous planning throughout the project. C. Waterfall emphasizes detailed documentation while Agile focuses more on working software and less on documentation. D. Waterfall is less accomodating to changes once once the process has started while Agile is built to handle changes at any point. E. Waterfall is often better suited for large. well-defined projects while Agile excels in complex, evolving projects. An example case scenario of Waterfall Methodology is when a government agency uses it to develop a new system of tax filling. Since the regulatory requirements are clear, the waterfall methodology would ensure that all stages are thoroughly planned and executed with minimal need for change. An example scenario for agile methodology is when a startup uses it to develop a mobile app to meet changing user needs in  competitive market. Agile allows the team to release a Minimum Viable Product quickly, gather user feedback and iteratively improve the product, ensuring it meets market demands.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. A. Software Developer- Writes code that makes up the application according to the specifications that the analyst provides, runs previous versions of tests to ensure the product works. B. Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures that the quality standards of a product are met, creates a list of tests that verify function, usability efficiency, maintainability and portability for each new requirement, runs all tests and investigates all failures. C. Project Manager- Is responsible for developing a project plan, recruits staff to fulfill other roles, leads and manages the team project, sets milestones and assigns tasks to different team members.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are able to tell you which words are spelled incorrectly, which phrases are unclear and syntax that you wrote incorrectly when writing code in the software development process. Some IDEs support features like code sharing, pair programming and team colllaboration tools making it easier for developers to work together on a project. Examples of popular IDEs include Visual Studio Code and Eclipse which is popular for Java, C++ and other languages with a robust plugin ecosystem. Version control systems allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes, enabling efficient collaboration. VCSs maintain a complete history of all changes made to the codebase, incuding who made each change, when and why, which is crucial for tracking the evolution of a project. VCSs act as a backup system, storing all vefrsions of the code in a central repository, which safeguards against data loss due to machine failures. Examples of popular VCSs include GitHub which is a repository hosting service and Git which is an open-source VC tool used to manage codes.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. A. Mnaging change requirements due to evolving client needs, market conditions or new insights during the development process can prove to be challenging. This can be dealt with by maintaining open communication with stakeholders to clarify priorities and ensure that changes are understood and documented. B. Dealing with technical debt is another challenge. This occurs when shortcuts are taken during development, leading to suboptimal code that can cause problems later. This can be overcome by regularly refactoring code, reviewing codesand automated testing. C. Balancing multiple tasks, meeting deadlines and managing time effectively are ongoing challenges, especially in fast-paced environments with tight schedules. This can be overcome by prioritizing tasks, using time management tools and setting realistic goals. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. A. Unit Testing involves testing individual components or units of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system. It is important in early detection of bugs, it simplifies debugging and improves code quality. B. Integration testing focuses on testing the interaction between integrated units or modules. It ensures that different parts of the software work together as expected. It identifies interface issues, ensures models work together and detects system-level errors. C. System testing involves testing the complete and fully integrated software system as a whole. It ensures that the software functions correctly in its entirety and meets the specified requirements. It validates the entire system, it stimulates real-world scenarios and ensures compliance with specifications. D. Acceptance testing is the final level of testing performed to determine whether the software is ready for delivery to the client or end-users. It is important in validating against business requirements, final approval for release and builds client confidence.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. It is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI models such as GPT and Copilot to produce desired outputs. Effective prompt engineering can significantly improve the relevance, accuracy and usefulness of the AI's responses. This is crucial in professional and academic contexts where precise information is required. By carefully crafting prompts, users can tailor the AI's responses to fit specific needs or contexts, whether it is for creative writing, technical explanations or decision-making support. It plays a critical role in optimizing how humans collaborate with AI. By understanding and applying effective prompt strategies, users can better leverage AI capabilities. leading to more productive and insightful outcomes.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. An example is when someone asks a question like: "Tell me about technology." This prompt lacks specificity since the term "technology" is broad and can refer to countless topics, including different fields or aspects, it is not clear whether the user is asking for a general overview, a historical perspective or something else. Instead the prompt can be improved by asking the following: "Provide a brief overview of the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare over the past two years." This prompt provides clarity by clearly asking for an overview, specifying the typr of content the user expects. It narrows down the broader topic of "technology" to "artificial intelligence" and further focuses on its "impact on healthcare."
